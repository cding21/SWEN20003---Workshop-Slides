## What is Object-Oriented Software Development (SWEN20003)?
Developing medium and large scale software systems requires analysis and design prior to implementation. This subject introduces students to software design, with specific focus on object-oriented design, and the implementation of designs using an object-oriented programming language. The subject aims to lay the foundations to software design, and is the first subject of a sequence of subjects that teaches the students the concepts in software design.

Topics covered include:
- Object-oriented programming techniques
- Object-oriented design concepts and modelling
- Design patterns and their applications
- Object-oriented frameworks.
